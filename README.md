<p>You can also use Line Breaks. This is the first line,<br>
and this is the second line</p

We created a new branch called development and merged it together with main so 
we have a safe checkpoint for our code

Moving on we are going to look at <em>italic styling</em> and also <strong>bold styling</strong>.
You can combine them to create <em><strong>a really stylish text</strong></em>.


We also have blockquotes which can be used like this.
>This is a blockquote
>
>This is also a blockquote, but still in the same blockquote.

You can also use Nested Blockquotes

>This is a blockquote
>
>>this is the nested blockquote

Moving on.

Lists can be ordered and unordered.
This is an ordered list.

<ol>
<li>First item</li>
<li>Second item</li>
<li>Third item</li>
<li>Fourth item</li>
</ol>

and this is an unordered list.
<ul>
<li>First item</li>
<li>Second item</li>
<li>Third item</li>
<li>Fourth item</li>
</ul>
